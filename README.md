All pages: Skeleton framework's column system does not work properly in Internet Explorer; most elements stretch to fit the width of the screen. Additionally, top navbar icons do not load properly in IE. It is currently too late to rectify this without switching to another framework entirely.

All pages except index.html: Home, refresh and settings icons do not load properly in Firefox.

index.html: Buttons are invalid when descendents of anchor elements, but it's currently the only way to link them.

add-item.html and item-detail.html: Rows anchored to the left side in Internet Explorer.

All pages have been validated.
